# num_sort
This project provides:

**num_sort**: a utility to benchmarks the time it takes to read a file containing random numbers, sort them and then store the sorted list in an output file. This is part of testing I am doing to compare language performance. I have added similar projects for java and haskell.

To compile :

```cargo build --release``` 


A file containing integers is required to run the test. A test file with random integers can be generated by using RandGen utility provided in [here](https://github.com/aha0x0x/NumSort "NumSort")

To run: 

```target/release/num_sort /tmp/10000000.random```
